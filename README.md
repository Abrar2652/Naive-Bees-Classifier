# Naive-Bees-Classifier

## Dataset Collection
[DrivenData Competition: Naive Bees Classifier](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/8/naive-bees-classifier/)

## What I learnt 
<p> 
  I built an algorithm that identifies either honey bees or bumble bees in each photograph, despite those photographs having great variety in their backgrounds, positions, and image resolutions. Since this competition has ended 5 years earlier from today (2021), I didn't get the chance to participate to solve this supervised machine learning classfication problem.

<p>
  I created two different sub-projects in a single project, while the first one is about image loading and processing using PILLOW library, and the second one is about predicting bee species from those images. In this project, I've learned about the image manipulation techniques, how to work with the images in array or matrix level, making image data comprehensive for machines, reducing thousands of features to several most important components, and also tuning the thresholds of machine learning models.

## Where to improve
<p>
  I've initially worked with Support Vector Classifier which produced reasonable score. But there is always place for improvements using deep learning models. The first positin holder team of this competition achieved the accuracy over 99%. They utilized GoogleNet for this classification task, but that's not the limit. In the future, there will be far more research and development in Machine Learning and Convolutional Neural Network that might help outperform GoogleNet that the winner team used. I built only one model because I'm not familiar with Convolutional Neural Network and Deep Learning Models yet. In the future, I'll try to improve my score and update this repo after mastering more models and image manipulation techniques.
